Purpose: The purpose of this programs that are written in C++  and C is to implement a matrix expression that computes 
D =  A + (3 * B x C^t)
Where:
- `A` is a 2Ã—2 matrix
- `B` is a 2Ã—3 matrix
- `C` is a 2Ã—3 matrix, and `Cáµ€` is its transpose (3Ã—2)
- `D` is the resulting 2Ã—2 matrix after computing the expression

The program demonstrates:
- Matrix scaling (multiplying `B` by a scalar value `3`)
- Matrix transposition (`Cáµ€`)
- Matrix multiplication between a 2Ã—3 and a 3Ã—2 matrix
- Element-wise matrix addition between `A` and the result of the product
- Matrix printing to the console

### ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- Language: C (C99 Standard) or C++
- Compiler: GCC (x86 architecture)

### ðŸ”§ Compilation Instructions

#### For C version:
```bash
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -o matrix matrix.c
./matrix

for C++:
g++ -o matrix matrix.cpp
