# Byte-to-ASCII Hex Converter in x86 Assembly

## Description

This program takes an array of 8 bytes stored in memory and converts each byte into its **two-character hexadecimal ASCII representation**, separated by spaces. It then outputs the result to the terminal followed by a newline.

Each byte (e.g., `0x83`) is split into two 4-bit nibbles:
- The **high nibble** (e.g., `8`) and
- The **low nibble** (e.g., `3`)

Each nibble is converted to its corresponding ASCII character (`'8'`, `'3'`) and stored in an output buffer. A space character `' '` is added after each byte, and a newline character is appended at the end.
